Patches for various mods to use the RePower-system for a more realistic power consumption.
If you are using a mod that is missing here, just leave a comment with a link to it and I'll add it to the pack if compatible!

This pack contains all my other RePower-patches.

Can be used with either the [RePowerReborn-mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845531445) or my extended version [Turn It On and Off - RePowered](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2228219259)
